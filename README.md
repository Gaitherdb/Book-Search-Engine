  ## Description
  A web application that allows a user to search for books. A user can save the book details to their profile, or remove them by a click of a button. This application is created using a MERN stack, which means I use a MongoDB database, Express.js to communicate with the browser, React to create the front-end, and Node to create the backend. The search data comes from a Google REST API, but the gathered data uses GraphQL API endpoints to communicate with the MongoDB database. User-authorization is handled by JSON Web Tokens and saved to the browser through local storage. 

   This app makes use of a few node modules to make the development easier, including: Express, Mongoose, Apollo-Server-Express, Bcrypt, jsonwebtoken and graphql. This app makes use of:
  * Node.js and Express.js to create a single RESTful API for google books api
  * Apollo-Server-Express and GraphQL to make GraphQL API endpoints
  * Queries and Mutations to interact with the database from front-end
  * typeDefs and Resolvers to recieve data from front-end on the back-end and communicate with the database
  * MongoDB (noSQL) and Mongoose OMT for the database
  * JWT for authorization of logged in users
  * Bcrypt for encrypting password information
